	<p>PSPDFKit powers the <a href="http://www.pwc.com.au/assurance/ifrs/publications/tools-report-writing/value-accounts-holdings/index.htm">Value Accounts Holdings 2013 App</a> - the premier reference on financial reporting in Australia. PwC used several advanced features of PSPDFKit to deeply integrate it into their app and make it more interactive. They used the <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/documentation/Protocols/PSPDFViewControllerDelegate.html#//api/name/pdfViewController:didSelectText:withGlyphs:atRect:onPageView:">delegate hooks</a> to get notified whenever the user selects certain text and offer customize options in the popup menu to look up references. This saved them a lot of time compared to manually linking about 100 publications. They're using the annotation features to allow users to take notes, add text or scribble on the pages.</p><br>

	<blockquote>
	<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alan_lahiff">Alan Lahiff</a>: "PSPDFKit it is without a doubt the easiest iOS PDF framework to use on the market. It is solid and provides a wealth of features that are world class, and some of which aren't even offered by competitors. In addition, the example projects (particularly PSPDFCatalog) are a fantastic way to get started and it is something on which I rely to develop my app.<br>
	My users and stakeholders have been blown away by what I have produced with PSPDFKit, and my company approved the purchase of a license without a second thought - it was simply a no-brainer."</p><br><br>
